# ✈️ Aviation Image Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements an aircraft detection and classification pipeline using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. It aims to identify different aircraft types from images, analyze their strength, and determine their suitability for combat scenarios.

## 🧠 Model Pipeline

1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   - Aircraft image dataset (multi-class)
   - Image augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip)

2. **Model Architecture**  
   - CNN with multiple Conv2D + MaxPooling layers  
   - Dense layers with ReLU and Dropout for regularization  
   - Output layer with Softmax activation

3. **Training & Evaluation**  
   - Optimizer: Adam  
   - Loss: Categorical Crossentropy  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall

4. **Post-processing**  
   - Mapping predictions to aircraft metadata (range, payload, speed)
   - Determining combat effectiveness based on criteria
